        The <b>largest</b> energy consumers in the world are Norway, United States, Canada, Iceland and the wealthy
        nations in
        the middle east such as United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia. These countries consume about
        <b>100</b>
        times more per average person than third world countries.

        As of <b>2022</b>, the <b>largest</b> global source of energy comes from <b>oil</b> followed by <b>coal</b>, 
        <b>gas</b> and <b>hydropowe</b>r. An <b>upsurge</b> in <b>coal</b> consumption can first be noticed after the 
        era of <b>Industrial Revolution</b> at 1840 as manufacturing processes went through a significant transition.

        Amongst renewable energy sources, <b>Tidal</b> energy holds the <b>highest</b> share in power generation at <b>50.14%</b> 
        with a contribution of <b>19448.16 TWh</b> of energy. <b>Geothermal</b> and <b>Solar PV</b> has the <b>lowest</b> 
        contribution for global renewable energy summing up to only <b>2.46%</b> with a contribution of <b>955.91 TWh</b> of
        energy since they are very expensive to set up.

        <b>China</b> leads the market for renewable energy production of <b>all three</b> sources (Biofuel, Hydro, Solar PV).
        The anomaly that can be spotted in the listed countries is <b>Russia</b>, while being in top 10 contributors, it's share 
        of renewable energy comes <b>only</b> from Hydro.

        Primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions show a <b>positive</b> correlation. <b>Asia Pacific</b> region can be seen

        Since <b>2012</b>, a drastic increase can be seen in levels of CO2 emissions. A large <b>drop</b> in emission can be seen at 
        <b>2020</b> which can be speculated as being caused by the outbreak of Covid-19. In <b>2021</b>, the levels <b>rise</b> back 
        up again. From <b>2012</b> to <b>2021</b>, global carbon dioxide emissions had increased by <b>1979 million tonnes</b>.
