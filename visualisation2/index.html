  <h1>WORLDWIDE ENERGY</h1>
  <p style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-size: 25px">Global energy production</p>
  <p>
    The availability of energy has transformed the course of humanity over the last few centuries. 
    Not only have new sources of energy been unlocked - first fossil fuels, followed by a diversification to nuclear, 
    hydropower and now other renewable technologies - but also in the quantity we can produce and consume.</p>
  <p>
    Demand for energy is growing across many countries in the world, as people get richer and populations increase.
    If this increased demand is not offset by improvements in energy efficiency elsewhere, then our global energy consumption 
    will continue to grow year-on-year. Growing energy consumption makes the challenge of transitioning our energy systems away 
    from fossil fuels towards low-carbon sources of energy more difficult: new low-carbon energy has to meet this additional 
    demand and try to displace existing fossil fuels in the energy mix.

  <p style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-size: 25px">Renewable energy</p>
  <p>
    Since the Industrial Revolution, the energy mix of most countries across the world has become dominated by fossil fuels. 
    This has major implications for the global climate, as well as for human health. Three-quarters of global greenhouse gas 
    emissions result from the burning of fossil fuels for energy. And fossil fuels are responsible for large amounts of local 
    air pollution - a health problem that leads to at least 5 million premature deaths each year.

    Given below are some of the of the statistics revolving around renewable energy and it's major sources of contribution, 
    alongside the data for top 10 countries that produce the highest quantity of renewable energy.
